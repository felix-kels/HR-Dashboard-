# HR-Dashboard-Using-SQL-and-Power BI



This project analyzes the HR Employee Dataset of a company using SQL and Power BI. The dataset contains information about the employees including their name, birthdate,
gender, ethnicity, department, job title, location, date of hire, and date of termination (if applicable).

The objective of this project is to provide insights into the employee demographics, job titles, departments, locations, tenure, and turnover using SQL to clean
and prepare the data and Power BI to visualize it.

## Project Files
The project includes the following files:

- HR Database.sql: SQL script used to clean and prepare the dataset.
- HR Employee Report.pbix: Power BI report that displays the data analysis and visualization.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Source
The data source is a CSV file named "Human Resources.csv" that contains the employee data.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The SQL script is used to clean and prepare the data before importing it into Power BI. The following tasks are done in the script:

- Dropping the unnecessary columns
- Renaming the columns to meaningful names
- Converting data types to their appropriate types
- Handling null values
- Creating new calculated columns for further analysis

## Data Analysis and Visualization
The cleaned and prepared dataset is imported into Power BI, where the data is analyzed and visualized. The following questions are answered in the report:

- What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
- What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
- What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
- How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
- How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
- What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
- Which department has the highest turnover rate?
- What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
- How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
- What is the tenure distribution for each department?

The Power BI report presents the answers to these questions in the form of charts, tables, and graphs.

## Conclusion
The HR Employee Dataset Analysis Project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize employee data. 
The insights gained from the analysis can help companies make informed decisions about their workforce, such as identifying diversity gaps, 
assessing job satisfaction, and optimizing workforce deployment. By answering the above questions, this project provides a comprehensive overview of the
employee demographics, job titles, departments, locations, tenure, and turnover in the company.
